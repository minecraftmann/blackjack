AWS SERVERLESS BLACKJACK

APIGATEWAY, COGNITO, LAMBDA, DYNAMODB, CLOUDFORMATION

Some COORS configuration was done manually on the console.


Currently allows access origin * since were using localhost for dev purposes.
To test, put the index.html file on a web server listening on localhost on port 80


For next time:
- The Cognito setup can be decoupled from the API and have its own CloudFormation template
- Set up a wildcard OPTIONS function for CORS instead of one per request
- Remember to make more regular commits
- Design for use with Auth code flow vs Implicit flow
